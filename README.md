This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 2.7.1

* Rails version: 6.0.3.4

* Added to manifest.js 

        //= link_directory ../stylesheets/admin .css

    because a I added a subfolder admin.
